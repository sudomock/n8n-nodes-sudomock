## 📦 Demo Workflows

### 1. POD Product Creator - Bulk Mockup Generator

**File:** `pod-product-creator-workflow.json`

**Perfect for:** Etsy sellers, Redbubble creators, Shopify merchants, print-on-demand entrepreneurs

Automate the tedious process of creating product mockups for every design variant. This workflow processes multiple designs across multiple product templates (t-shirts, mugs, posters, phone cases, tote bags) in one automated flow.

**What it does:**
- 📂 Monitors Google Drive folder for new designs
- 🔄 Creates design × product template combinations (nested loops)
- 🎨 Renders high-quality mockups for each combination
- 📊 Generates CSV export compatible with Printful and Printify
- 📧 Sends completion email with summary and download link

**Key Features:**
- **Batch Processing:** Process 100+ design-product combinations unattended
- **Integration Ready:** Works with Google Drive, Printful, Printify, Cloudinary
- **Rate Limit Safe:** Sequential processing prevents API throttling
- **Error Resilient:** Continues processing even if individual renders fail

**ROI Example:**
Manual mockup creation: 6 minutes per design-product combo
100 designs × 10 products = 1,000 mockups = **100 hours of manual work**
Automated with this workflow: **~2 hours unattended**

**Use Cases:**
- Launching new design collections across product catalog
- A/B testing designs on different product mockups
- Seasonal product updates (holiday designs, summer collections)
- Bulk preparing mockups for marketplace listings

### 2. App Screenshot Generator - Multi-Device Automation

**File:** `app-screenshot-generator-workflow.json`

**Perfect for:** iOS developers, Android developers, indie app makers, SaaS companies, mobile agencies

Eliminate the manual work of creating device-specific screenshots for App Store and Google Play submissions. This workflow integrates with your CI/CD pipeline to auto-generate professionally mocked screenshots.

**What it does:**
- 🔗 Webhook-triggered from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or manual
- 📱 Generates screenshots for iPhone 15 Pro, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro mockups
- ⚡ Parallel processing (2 concurrent renders) for speed
- 📦 Creates ZIP archive organized by device and locale
- 💬 Sends Slack notification when ready
- ☁️ Uploads to Google Drive for team access

**Key Features:**
- **CI/CD Integration:** Trigger from deployment pipeline
- **Multi-Device Support:** iPhone, iPad, Mac, Android templates
- **Locale Ready:** Structure output for multi-language submissions
- **Team Collaboration:** Automatic Slack notifications and Drive uploads

**ROI Example:**
Manual screenshot creation: 20 minutes per device × 4 devices = 1.3 hours
Per app update × 12 updates/year = **16 hours annually**
Automated: **~5 minutes per update**

**Use Cases:**
- App Store submission preparation
- Product Hunt launch assets
- Website and landing page device mockups
- Marketing campaign creative generation
- Investor pitch deck automation

### 3. Content Creator Mockup Batch - Social Media Automation

**File:** `content-creator-mockup-batch-workflow.json`

**Perfect for:** Instagram creators, LinkedIn influencers, agency content teams, social media managers

Transform a single design into platform-optimized mockups across all social networks automatically. This workflow watches for new designs and generates perfectly sized, branded variants for each platform.

**What it does:**
- 👀 Watches Google Drive folder for new design uploads

- 🖼️ Generates variants: Square (1:1), Story (9:16), Wide (16:9), Portrait (4:5)
- 🎨 Adds custom watermark/branding automatically
- 📅 Schedules posts to Buffer with optimal timing
- 📁 Organizes files by platform in Google Drive

**Key Features:**
- **Platform Optimization:** Correct aspect ratios and dimensions for each network
- **Branding Automation:** Watermark, logo, and color overlay options
- **Buffer Integration:** Auto-schedule to Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn
- **Folder Organization:** Clean file structure by platform and date

**ROI Example:**
Manual social media prep: 15 minutes per design × 4 platforms = 1 hour
Weekly content (5 designs) = **5 hours/week** = 260 hours/year
Automated: **30 minutes/week**

**Use Cases:**
- Weekly social media content batches
- Product launch campaigns across platforms
- Client showcase portfolio updates
- Course or ebook promotional graphics
- Brand consistency across channels

## ⚠️ Important Notice

> **These workflows are conceptual implementations** designed to showcase production-ready automation patterns. While they demonstrate real-world use cases and follow best practices for n8n workflow design, **they have not been extensively tested in live production environments**.
>
> We recommend using these as **starting points and inspiration** for building your own custom automation. You'll likely need to adapt node configurations, add error handling specific to your environment, and test thoroughly before deploying to production.
>
> Consider these **advanced templates** rather than plug-and-play solutions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using these workflows, you'll need:

**1. n8n Workflow Automation**
- Self-hosted n8n (v1.0.0+) or n8n.cloud account
- [Download n8n](https://n8n.io) or [Try n8n Cloud](https://n8n.cloud)

**2. SudoMock API Account**
- 500 credits on signup, granted once, no credit card required
- [Sign up at sudomock.com](https://sudomock.com)
- Generate API key from dashboard

**3. PSD Mockup Templates**
- Upload your PSD files with smart object layers
- Or find free mockups: [Freepik](https://freepik.com), [Mockup World](https://mockupworld.co)
- Templates needed:
  - **POD workflow:** Product mockups (t-shirt, mug, poster, etc.)
  - **App workflow:** Device mockups (iPhone 15, iPad Pro, MacBook)
  - **Content workflow:** Context mockups (laptop, phone, billboard)

**4. Third-Party Integrations (optional)**
- **Google Drive** - For file storage and triggers
- **Buffer** - For social media scheduling (Content Creator workflow)
- **Slack** - For team notifications

### Rate Limits & Plans

Every account gets a **1000 requests/minute** base rate limit. What changes between
plans is how many renders run at once.

**Pay as you go** is the entry tier and needs no subscription: $0.10 per PSD render,
so $1 covers 10, with a $5 minimum first payment. 2D Mockups and video are priced by
what they cost to produce rather than at the flat render rate.

**Before a card is verified**, a new account is in trial:
- 500 credits, granted once, and they do not renew
- 1 render at a time
- Renders come back watermarked and capped at 1,024 px
- 5 PSD templates, and one that goes 13 days without a render is removed
- Enough to run these workflows end to end and see real output

Verifying a card and funding the $5 minimum lifts every limit in that list at once:
the watermark and the width cap come off, stored templates go to 150, renders run 25
at a time alongside 10 concurrent uploads, and templates stop being removed for
sitting idle. It does not change your tier: trial is the unfunded state of pay as
you go, not a separate plan.

**Volume plans** start at $25/month for 5,000 renders and buy a monthly credit
allowance at a lower rate per render, plus more template storage on the higher
tiers. Parallel renders are 3 on Starter, 10 on Pro, and 25 on Scale. The lowest
self-serve rate is $2.42 per 1,000 renders on the annual Pro 50K plan.
